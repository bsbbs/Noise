# Overview

This is a repository for a manuscript under review, titled "Origins of noise in both improving and degrading decision making". This is an unpublished work. The contents may change during the revision.

# Repo Contents

- [Empirical data](./myData): Human choice data created by the current project. Please check the [README file](./myData/README.txt) for further information about the data structure and variables.
- [Simulation code](./ModelSimulationCode): Matlab code for the modeling part of the paper. To replicate the simulation, please follow the main files [Fig1](./ModelSimulationCode/Fig1.m), [Fig2](./ModelSimulationCode/Fig2.m), and [Fig4](./ModelSimulationCode/Fig4.m).
- [Data analysis code](./BehavioralDataAnalysisCode.Rmd): `R` code for analyzing the empirical data. To replicate the data analysis, please change the directory of the data according to your local directory environment and follow the sections in the code.

# System Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

The [Matlab code](./)`lol` package requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the operations defined by a user. For minimal performance, this will be a computer with about 2 GB of RAM. For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:

RAM: 16+ GB  
CPU: 4+ cores, 3.3+ GHz/core

The runtimes below are generated using a computer with the recommended specs (16 GB RAM, 4 cores@3.3 GHz) and internet of speed 25 Mbps.

## Software Requirements

### OS Requirements

The package development version is tested on *Linux* and  operating systems. The developmental version of the package has been tested on the following systems:

Linux: Ubuntu 16.04  
Mac OSX:  
Windows:  

The CRAN package should be compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

Before setting up the `lolR` package, users should have `R` version 3.4.0 or higher, and several packages set up from CRAN.

#### Installing R version 3.4.2 on Ubuntu 16.04

the latest version of R can be installed by adding the latest repository to `apt`:

```
sudo echo "deb http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key E084DAB9
gpg -a --export E084DAB9 | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev
```

which should install in about 20 seconds.

# Installation Guide

## Stable Release

`lolR` is available in a stable release on CRAN:

```
install.packages('lolR')
```

## Development Version

### Package dependencies

Users should install the following packages prior to installing `lolR`, from an `R` terminal:

```
install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'abind', 'irlba', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'latex2exp', 'MASS', 'randomForest'))
```

which will install in about 30 seconds on a machine with the recommended specs.

The `lolR` package functions with all packages in their latest versions as they appear on `CRAN` on December 13, 2017. Users can check [CRAN snapshot](https://mran.microsoft.com/timemachine/) for details. The versions of software are, specifically:
```
abind_1.4-5
latex2exp_0.4.0
ggplot2_2.2.1
irlba_2.3.1
Matrix_1.2-3
MASS_7.3-47
randomForest_4.6-12
```

If you are having an issue that you believe to be tied to software versioning issues, please drop us an [Issue](https://github.com/neurodata/lol/issues). 

### Package Installation

From an `R` session, type:

```
require(devtools)
install_github('neurodata/lol', build_vignettes=TRUE, force=TRUE)  # install lol with the vignettes
require(lolR)
vignette("lol", package="lolR")  # view one of the basic vignettes
```

The package should take approximately 40 seconds to install with vignettes on a recommended computer. 

# Demo

## Functions

For interactive demos of the functions, please check out the vignettes built into the package. They can be accessed as follows:

```
require(lolR)
vignette('lol')
vignette('pca')
vignette('cpca')
vignette('lrcca')
vignette('mdp')
vignette('xval')
vignette('qoq')
vignette('simulations')
vignette('nearestCentroid')
```

## Extending the lolR Package

The lolR package makes many useful resources available (such as embedding and cross-validation) for simple extension. 

To extend the lolR package, check out the vignettes:

```
require(lolR)
vignette('extend_embedding')
vignette('extend_classification')
```

# Results

In this [benchmark comparison](http://docs.neurodata.io/lol/lol-paper/figures/real_data.html), we show that LOL does better than all linear embedding techniques in supervised HDLSS settings when dimensionality is high (d > 100, ntrain <= d) on 20 benchmark problems from the [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and [PMLB](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/penn-ml-benchmarks) datasets. LOL provides a good tradeoff between maintaining the class conditional difference (good misclassification rate) in a small number of dimensions (low number of embedding dimensions).
